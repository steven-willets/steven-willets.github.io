			<h2>Usurper of the Porcelain Throne</h2>
			<p>If my previous journal established anything, it's that I have little motivation for maintaining a pretense of absurd masculinity. Some things are just unsettling, like a closet door that opens of its own volition, noises with no discernible source when you're alone in a house, or in this particular case, a bug that's so big you don't want to squish it because you don't want to have to find a mop.</p>
			<p>Let me just qualify this though. I am from New England, also know as 'Original America', 'Authentic America', and 'That Place That's Embarrassed by the Rest of America'. 
			In the Northeast, or 'Civilization' as I like to call it, our bugs can fit comfortably inside a bottle cap. Big to us is something the size of a quarter.</p>
			<p>I first beheld the insect as I strode into the bathroom. It had become trapped in the bottom of the sink, vainly trying to scramble up the side with all the luck of a fat guy on a treadmill. It's conjecture at this point as to whether the side were too slippery or if the gravitational pull on something that large prevents it from climbing up inclines.</p>
			<p>To paraphrase my initial reaction 
			"HOLY SHIT! THAT THING IS FUCKING HUUUUUUUGE"</p>
			<p>And I did what anyone would do when confronted with something contrary to all that they know and love... 
			Find a damn camera.</p>
			<p>It wasn't so much scary as it was shocking and gross... and slightly worrisome.
			I recoiled only once -- when I brought the camera too close and it revealed that it had wings. 
			WINGS. 
			I could only hope it was the ostrich of bugs, it certainly shared a size ratio to other bugs that ostriches share with other birds. 
			But then, it wasn't my safety I was worried about, but the safety of my hair. 
			If I know two things about girls it's that they scream over the prospect of something flying into their hair and that they look upon my hair with bitter envy, so it seems logical to me that I am entitled to be more protective of mine than they are of theirs, after all, mine is better.</p>
			<p>It was with this revelation about the possibility of flight that I felt less secure in it's inability to escape. 
			I had the reaction any red-blooded American would to something they regard as bothersome: 
			"Time to smoke the fucker."</p>
			<p>It was too big to wash down the sink, too big to squish, and too jumpy to approach. 
			A previous attempt to drown it had provided it with a rising-water elevator, allowing it to establish a hold further up the sink wall. It seemed to be making progress, which meant I didn't want to turn my back on it to find a baseball bat or small sedan to properly deal with this threat.</p>
			<p>Searching for something nearby, I found a plastic wrapper for paper towels in the trash and threw it on top of the bug.
			Okay, now I can't see it, that's certainly a start.
			Now what?
			I get a handful of toilet paper, because hey, it's not just that I don't want to touch it, I don't want to feel it either.</p>
			<p>It was the size of a goldfish so I used the same manner of execution - Flushing.</p>
			<p>...And I closed the toilet lid, just to be safe.</p>
